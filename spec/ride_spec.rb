# spec/ride_spec.rb

# The Ride class is responsible for holding information about individual rides. 
# This test file validates that the Ride class can initialize with correct attributes 
# and provides methods to check if the ride is a loop and calculate total distance.
# Do this so I can move to Iteration 3 without having to double check my code after each Iteration.

require './lib/ride' # Load the Ride class to test it

# Describe block for the Ride class to group all tests related to Ride.
